Write a program called setupClass; this program creates a directory structure for all of your files associated with the exercises, assignments, and tests.

The setupClass program has one optional command line argument which represents the name of the root directory to setup; if the argument is omitted
then the root directory should default to "sysProg".

The directory structure should be constructed as follows:

                                                                                                                      <root>
                                  test                                          program                                                                                                exercise

                       test1  test2  test3        prog1 prog2 prog3 prog4 prog5                       exer1 exer2 exer3 exer4 exer5 exer6 exer7 exer8 exer9 exer10

 

Use loops and system calls to construct this directory structure.
