For this program, we will be using the dataFlow.dat file we created with Exercise 1. 

Write a reports the status of the fake flow device we are simulating with dataFlow.dat. 

Your program needs to print an alert message to the screen anytime it reads a value that isn't 
between 950 and 1050. If the values are between 450 and 550, the program should report that
pressure in the lines is "low"; if the values are between 1450 and 1550, the program should report
that the pressure in the lines is "high."  The program should also report the number of data entries 
read since the last Alert occurred.
